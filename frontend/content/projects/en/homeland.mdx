# Homeland â€“ A Raspberry Pi Powered by Proxmox

After setting up my main Proxmox server, I wanted to expand my home network with several **Wireguard** addresses. The idea: to be able to connect from different locations â€” especially my parents' home â€” to help them remotely if needed.

---

## Choosing the Hardware

For this, I invested in a **Raspberry Pi 4B (4 GB RAM)**. Lightweight, discreet, and perfectly suited for this kind of task, it was set to become my little decentralized stronghold.

---

## And the Operating System?

I quickly wondered which OS to use. Before long, I settled on **Proxmox**, after discovering a *non-official* but working version for the Pi.

Curious, I tested it, and it fit my needs perfectly. I havenâ€™t looked back since!

## Setting Up the Services

Once the system was ready, I installed several essential services:

- **Wireguard** â€“ for VPN connections  
- **Cloudflare Tunnel** â€“ to securely expose certain services  
- **Deluge** â€“ for torrent downloading

---

## A Board That Never Sleeps

Since the Raspberry Pi often sits idle, I decided to make it useful: **sharing Linux distributions via torrent** to support open source (Ubuntu, Kali, EndeavourOS, etc.).

---

## Backups and Remote Storage

With the improved backup system on my **Nextcloud instance**, I needed additional storage space.

So I added a **500 GB SSD via USB**, and set up an **rClone** remote storage repository. This lets me back up my data securely and sync it with other services.

## ðŸ”— Homeland Service Summary

Today, *Homeland* proudly fulfills three key roles in my infrastructure:

- **Wireguard** â€“ Private VPN access
- **Deluge** â€“ Sharing Linux distributions
- **rClone/Borg** â€“ Secure and remote backups

This small Raspberry Pi â€” silent but powerful â€” has become an essential link in my personal network. And above all, it keeps me connected, even from afar.
