## Why Nextcloud?

At the start of my self-hosting journey, I was using a 100 GB Google Drive subscription. It was affordable in the short term, but after discovering **Nextcloud**, I quickly changed my mind.

Nextcloud offered me **the same services**, with the added benefit of **full control over my data** — and at a much lower cost. No more depending on third-party services: I finally had a free, self-hosted alternative.

## First installation: LXC and its limitations

The first time I installed Nextcloud, it was in an **LXC container** on my **Proxmox** server, using an automated script. I had a CT (container) fully dedicated to Nextcloud.

But over time, data began to pile up… and a problem quickly emerged: **backups became too large**, since they included both the system and my personal files.

---

## Optimization with ZFS

To fix this, I moved my data storage to my **ZFS pool** mounted on an **SSD**. This allowed me to better structure my folders, separate data from the system, and most importantly, make the backups **lighter and more efficient**.

---

## Migration to Docker

After several months, I hit the limits of my LXC setup. I then migrated to a **Docker Compose** solution, accompanied by a **custom Nginx proxy**.

This new architecture gives me **complete control** over each component: databases, cron jobs, storage... and it’s much more **scalable** and **modular**.

---

## Smart backups

Then I came to a slightly embarrassing realization: my backups were only saving **Nextcloud’s configuration**, not the **user data**.

So I set up a full solution:
- **Borg Backup** for compressed, efficient backups
- **rClone** to sync these backups to a remote directory

Today, my data is:
- stored locally on **RAID1 HDD**
- duplicated to a **Raspberry Pi** in another geographic location

---

## Conclusion

Thanks to this infrastructure, I can confidently say that my data is **durable**, **secure**, and **fully under my control**.

Nextcloud is much more than just a personal cloud: it’s a **core building block** of my free and open digital architecture.
