# My exploration of the world of cryptocurrency

Like many people, Iâ€™ve had a casual interest in the topic without ever diving in seriously. Of course, Iâ€™ve followed the markets with curiosity, heard the stories surrounding **Bitcoin** and other crypto-assets...

But my only real experience dates back to **2017**, when I tried to mine bitcoin. I had used:

- Some obscure software (that kept everything for itselfâ€¦)
- A command-line tool so rudimentary it scared me

---

## Discovering Monero

Years later, a simple explainer video about **Monero** reignited my interest.  
I was drawn to the project by its **ideal of decentralization and anonymity**.

I decided to dig deeper.

---

## First experiments

I started by installing Moneroâ€™s official GUI wallet, connected to a remote node.  
But that wasnâ€™t good enough for me: **I wanted full control**.

So I chose to **run my own Monero node**. Hereâ€™s how I did it:

1. Downloaded precompiled binaries from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/releases/)
2. Encountered some bugs
3. **Manually recompiled** each tool for a fully customized setup

---

## My current setup

Hereâ€™s what my installation looks like today:

- **Full Monero node** stored on a **ZFS SSD pool**
  - Advantages: better backup management + smaller backup size (blockchain can be redownloaded)
  - Current blockchain size: **~230 GB**

- **P2Pool node**  
  Allows for **decentralized mining** with other miners (lower fees and better privacy)

- **Secure remote miner connection** via:
  - A reverse proxy [FRP](https://github.com/fatedier/frp)
  - No Tor relay: I consider the **secure reverse proxy to be sufficient**
  - Only the P2Pool node is exposed, the wallet remains unreachable

---

## Result after 2 months

After around **2 months of mining**, Iâ€™ve earned:

> **0.025 Monero (~â‚¬7)**

-> Totally not profitable in terms of electricity...  
-> But itâ€™s **highly profitable in terms of learning**.

---

## ðŸ”š Conclusion

My journey into cryptocurrency has mainly helped me understand **what goes on behind the scenes**:  
- The technical mechanics  
- The security challenges  
- The ideals behind projects like Monero

I havenâ€™t become rich, but **Iâ€™ve learned**, and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m really after.
