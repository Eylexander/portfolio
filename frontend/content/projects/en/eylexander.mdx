# Redesigning My Portfolio: From Bootstrap to React

Since the beginning, my website has always aimed to **showcase my skills in web development**. But let’s be honest — the first version of my portfolio, launched in 2021, was simply a **modified Bootstrap template**. Back then, it was mainly used to present a few basic projects — mostly Discord bots I had built.

## A Redesign Driven by Learning

When I started my higher education and began learning programming more seriously, I felt the need for a complete overhaul. This second version was more structured: it featured a project gallery, animated cards, and a slightly cleaner design. It got the job done — barely.

## This Time, I Wanted to Do It Right

With more experience (and more motivation), I decided to **start from scratch** — but properly this time, using a modern and solid tech stack.

My goal was to build a website **entirely in React.js**, styled with **TailwindCSS**, and containerized with **Docker** to avoid versioning issues during deployment. On top of that, I also wrote a **Golang API** that connects to a **MongoDB** database. Although it’s not yet in use, it’s ready for future integrations.

## Design and Inspiration

For the design, I took a lot of inspiration from the clean and elegant [chronark website](https://chronark.com). After many iterations and dozens of hours of work, **eylexander.xyz has become what you see today**.

And this is just the beginning.
