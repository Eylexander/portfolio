# My Experiments with Flutter

I've known about Flutter for a long time. I still remember the very first project I started with this framework: the classic default template. But back then, I didn’t go beyond that simple splash screen. Maybe it was due to some technical issues getting it to run properly, or simply a lack of opportunity.

## A First Concrete Immersion

It wasn’t until more recently, as part of my studies, that I truly dove into Flutter. Two separate occasions allowed me to learn to use it seriously: once in May 2024, then again in March 2025.

My first real hands-on experience came through a [todo list app](https://github.com/Eylexander/flutter_todo_list), connected to a Supabase database. This project allowed me to explore many features: theme customization, app name, and especially task management (sorting by name, creation date, or execution date).  
It was also my first real encounter with the **Provider** system, an essential concept in Flutter for state management.

## A Project Involving Embedded AI

A few months later, in another course, we were given a particularly exciting exercise: to take inspiration from an existing Flutter project found online, reproduce it ourselves, and improve it.

The project in question used **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** to perform local image classification. A Flutter app embedding AI to recognize plants—pretty cool!

I took care to document the project thoroughly, which you can find here:

## An Enhanced Version with Gradio

But the journey didn’t stop there. We were then asked to integrate a **Hugging Face API via Gradio**, to enhance the application. Instead of making two separate projects, I decided to combine both systems: local recognition with TFLite **and** remote recognition via Gradio.

This led me to design a **specific provider** to allow for dynamic context switching. A real step up in my skills!

## My Thoughts

I genuinely enjoyed working on these projects. Flutter is truly a gem to me: quick to learn, powerful, and rewarding. It’s one of my **favorite tech tools**, and I fully intend to keep exploring it.
