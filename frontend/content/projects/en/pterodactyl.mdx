## Why Host Your Own Game Server?

Iâ€™ve always wanted to run my own **Minecraft** server so I could play with my friends.  
But renting a server from a well-known host costs money every month, without really giving me **full control** over the infrastructure.

With the help of my personal server, I spent a long time searching for the best way to self-host a game server in a **free, stable, and flexible** way.

## My Rudimentary Beginnings

At first, I simply used a **Proxmox CT** to run the server code.  
It was a very basic solution... and honestly unstable.

## Discovering Pterodactyl

Then one day, I came across **[Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/)**, an open source solution designed to host multiple game servers through a clear and well-designed interface.

A friend advised me to run it in a **dedicated VM**, to avoid the limitations of nested virtualization. Wise advice!

### A Docker-Friendly Architecture

Pterodactyl is built on **Docker**, which allows:

- launching isolated game servers,
- clean console access,
- and easy performance monitoring.

Itâ€™s also handy for running other non-gaming services.

## Installation: Not So Simple!

Installation gave me a bit of a hard time.  
The solution is based on two components:

- **Wings**, which actually hosts the servers,
- and the **Pterodactyl Panel**, which provides a web admin interface.

The real headache? Handling **SSL certificates** with my **Cloudflare reverse proxy**.  
But I eventually got it working by importing my SSL keys using **Acme.sh**.

## Making the Server Accessible (Without Exposing Your IP)

Small issue: a Minecraft server canâ€™t be proxied through Cloudflare because it uses port **25565**.  
Cloudflare doesnâ€™t support **proxying** on non-standard ports, which makes direct access impossible.

Also, I didnâ€™t want to expose my personal IP to my friends.

### The Solution: FRP

To work around this, I use the tool **[FRP](https://github.com/fatedier/frp)**.  
It allows me to connect my local server to a **small VPS** with a public IP.

By combining:

- an **A-type DNS redirect**,
- with an **SRV record**,

I can access my Minecraft server through a custom URL **without exposing my personal IP**.

> ðŸ§  In summary: Pterodactyl is a complete, powerful, and free solution for managing your own game servers â€” as long as you're ready to get your hands a little dirty.
