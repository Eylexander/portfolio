Proxmox is a powerful platform for managing virtualized environments, and this instance showcases its versatility by hosting a variety of services:

- **Jellyfin**: A media server that allows you to stream your personal media library across devices.
- **Nextcloud**: A self-hosted cloud storage solution for file sharing, collaboration, and data synchronization.
- **Ollama**: A platform for hosting and running AI models locally, ensuring privacy and control over your data.
- **Monero Node**: A cryptocurrency node that supports the Monero blockchain, enabling private and secure transactions.
- **Pterodactyl**: A game server management panel that simplifies hosting and managing game servers.

This Proxmox instance is a dynamic project, with the number and variety of services constantly evolving over time. As new needs arise or technologies emerge, additional services are integrated, making it a living example of the flexibility and scalability of self-hosted environments.

It also contains multiple artifacts such as :

- **SSD ZFS Pool** : There is about 7 TiB of storage made up from 5 different SSD assuring a huge volume of storage.
- **RAID1 HDDs** : To provide a cheap and efficient solution to local backups, I installed 2x 2 TiB HDD with RAID1 assuring 2 TiB of secure storage.
- **External Backup Storage** : As a fire can erupt at any moment, there is an off-site storage pool to keep the Nextcloud user data (using Borg and rClone).
