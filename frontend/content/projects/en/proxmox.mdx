## How It All Started

I started experimenting with **Proxmox** around June 2023 on an old laptop. A bit limited in terms of performance, I set myself a budget in November to build a more serious machine that could handle long-term use.

Rather than building a machine specifically tailored for “server” use, I opted for a **mainstream**, yet balanced setup, based on what I could afford.

## My Current Setup (2025)

Here’s the hardware configuration of my self-hosted server:

- **Case**: Fractal Design Node 804  
- **Motherboard**: Gigabyte B550M Aorus Elite  
- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X  
- **CPU Cooler**: be quiet! Pure Rock 2 Black  
- **RAM**: 64 GB DDR4 (4×16 GB 3200 MHz Kingston Fury Beast)  
- **Power Supply**: be quiet! Straight Power 12 – 750W  
- **Storage**:
  - Crucial P3 2 TB (NVMe)
  - Crucial BX500
  - 2× Seagate BarraCuda 2 TB

## Storage Organization

To get the most out of the available storage, I set up multiple systems using **ZFS** and software RAID:

- **ZFS SSD Pool**: A pool of 3 SSDs (BX500) combined into a **7 TB ZFS pool**. This ensures great speed for critical services and allows for better separation and organization of my containers.
- **ZFS HDD**: My two spinning hard drives run in **software RAID1**, ideal for long-term backup storage.  
- **Homeland**: A **remotely hosted Raspberry Pi** with a 500 GB SSD, used as a **backup point** (via Borg and rClone).

## My Self-Hosted Services

With this infrastructure, I’ve dived into the fascinating (and sometimes chaotic) world of **self-hosting**. Here are some of the services I’ve deployed:

### Jellyfin  
Media server that lets me stream various content across all my devices.  
-> Storage: **ZFS SSD**

### Nextcloud  
Open-source alternative to GAFAM for cloud storage, file sharing, and synchronization.  
-> Storage: **ZFS HDD** for backups (via Borg)

### Ollama + Open WebUI  
Local platform for running **LLM AI models**, with a user-friendly web interface.  
Very useful for testing LLMs without relying on the cloud.

### Monero Node  
Curious about crypto, I hosted a **Monero node** (~230 GB) to learn and mine independently.

### Pterodactyl  
Game server management panel. Runs inside a **dedicated VM** for more freedom and isolation.

## The Software Infrastructure

Except for Pterodactyl, all my services run in **dedicated LXC containers**, each with a **Docker** layer inside to orchestrate apps via **Docker Compose**. This model gives me:

- Clean isolation per service  
- Lower memory footprint than VMs  
- Greater flexibility in management

## A Constant Evolution

My Proxmox instance is a **living project**. Services evolve over time, depending on needs and interests. That’s the beauty of self-hosting: everything is modular, customizable, and improvable.

> This project has taught me a lot about infrastructure, security, service management… and it’s only the beginning.
