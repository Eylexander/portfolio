# My Year of Apprenticeship at Netlor

For my final year of studies, I had the opportunity to complete a one-year apprenticeship at **Netlor**, a company I was already familiar with thanks to a previous internship. I was able to continue working on a **research and development** project that is still not commercialized, allowing me to dive deep into its architecture and business logic.

Over the months, I learned a lot—both by discovering new technologies and by strengthening my knowledge of the ones I already knew.

## Golang

I discovered **Golang**, a language that combines **simplicity** and **performance**. I was surprised by its clarity and efficiency.

In the project, I developed **components** in Go, integrated into the existing project infrastructure. Moreover, the company developed its own internal framework, which allowed me to quickly add new features while respecting the project's structure.

## VueJS

Before this apprenticeship, I had never worked with **VueJS**. I learned how to create dynamic web interfaces, much more modern than traditional HTML/CSS.

I enhanced the existing interface with new **graphical elements**, while gaining a better understanding of **composability** and **interactivity** in modern web applications.

## Docker

I was already using **Docker** in a basic way for my Proxmox server, but here, I leveled up: I participated in creating **Docker images** to contain the microservices of our project.

It was a perfect opportunity to understand how to build, organize, and deploy services in a modular and clean way.

## Kubernetes

I had heard of Kubernetes, but never really used it.

Thanks to tools like **microk8s**, **k3s**, and later **Kubespray**, I learned to **deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters**.

With the help of **Ansible** and **Helm**, I understood how to automate and configure Kubernetes deployments easily while maintaining great flexibility.

## MongoDB

I had some basic knowledge from coursework, but this project really allowed me to get my hands dirty.

I learned how to interact with **MongoDB** in a real-world context and to understand its specificities, especially in a microservices architecture.

## On-Premise

Lastly, I discovered the challenges of **On-Premise** deployment—hosting the entire infrastructure internally without relying on a public cloud.

This type of deployment requires you to **manage security, updates, maintenance** yourself, as well as optimize hardware resources. A whole new dimension for me.

## Conclusion

This apprenticeship year brought me a lot:  
it allowed me to **professionalize my skills**, discover **new technologies**, and above all, **gain confidence** in my ability to contribute to a complex technical project.  
A decisive step for the rest of my career.

Thank you to **Netlor** and the entire team for this enriching experience!
